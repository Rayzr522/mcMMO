        [[YELLOW]]enchanted items. Depending on your level the chance of
        [[YELLOW]]successfully extracting a full or partial enchantment varies.

        [[YELLOW]]When an enchantment is partially extracted, the enchantment
        [[YELLOW]]book will have a lower level enchantment compared to what
        [[YELLOW]]it was on the item.

        [[DARK_AQUA]]About Acrobatics:
        [[YELLOW]]Acrobatics is the art of moving gracefully in mcMMO.
        [[YELLOW]]It provides combat bonuses and environment damage bonuses.

        [[DARK_AQUA]]XP GAIN:
        [[YELLOW]]To gain XP in this skill you need to perform a dodge
        [[YELLOW]]in combat or survive falls from heights that damage you.
      '2': |-
        [[DARK_AQUA]]How does Dodge work?
        [[YELLOW]]Dodge is a passive chance when you are
        [[YELLOW]]injured in combat to halve the damage taken.
        [[YELLOW]]It is tied to your skill level.
      '1': |-
        [[DARK_AQUA]]How does Rolling work?
        [[YELLOW]]You have a passive chance when you take fall damage
        [[YELLOW]]to negate the damage done. You can hold the sneak button to
        [[YELLOW]]double your chances during the fall.
        [[YELLOW]]This triggers a Graceful Roll instead of a standard one.
        [[YELLOW]]Graceful Rolls are like regular rolls but are twice as likely to
        [[YELLOW]]occur and provide more damage safety than regular rolls.
        [[YELLOW]]Rolling chance is tied to your skill level
